# CSharp_course
This is a repository for my solutions to the problems presented in this Udemy [C# course](https://www.udemy.com/course/programacao-orientada-a-objetos-csharp/).

This course is in "PT-BR", so a few things might be in portuguese throughout the repository, but most of it should be in english. Btw "Aula" means lesson.

The course was updated when I was midway through it, so a few of the lesson numbers might diverge from the number in the actual code/subfolders.


## Some context on lesson gaps:
### Sections 01\~04: Intro (Lessons 000\~048)
These lessons are introductory classes/installing VS Community/basics of C# and programming logic.

### Section 08: GitHub Crashcourse (Lessons 094\~120)
These teach the basics of GitHub and don't involve much coding at all. I wrote down notes, but I didn't save anything here.

### Section 12: Project 01 - Chess Game (Lessons 156\~193)
This was skipped for now. I may come back to this mini project in the future.
