# CSharp_course
This is a repository for my solutions to the problems presented in a Udemy C# course.

This course is in "PT-BR", so a few things might be in portuguese but most of it should be in english. Btw "Aula" means lesson.

The course was updated recently, so a few of the lesson numbers might look unnatural and I may update them in the future.
